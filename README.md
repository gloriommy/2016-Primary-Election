Predicting whether a given county will support Hillary Clinton with 2016 Kaggle Primary Election Data.
I use a number of machine learning algorithms to predict fraction of votes Hillary Clinton would receive in each county using information about the county provided by Kaggle.
Based on the parameters of the best model, most powerful predictive feature (information about the county) is identified in this project.
