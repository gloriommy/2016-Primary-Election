Predicting support for Hillary Clinton with 2016 Kaggle Primary Election Data.
I use a number of machine learning algorithms to predict the fraction of votes Hillary Clinton would receive in each county using various information about the county provided by Kaggle.
Based on the parameters of the best model, I discovered which feature (information about the county) is the most important in predicting support for Clinton.
